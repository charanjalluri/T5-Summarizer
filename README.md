# T5-Summarizer

**T5-Summarizer** is a text summarization project that leverages the power of the **Google T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)** model to generate concise and meaningful summaries of large text from various sources such as **PDF files**, **images**, and **audio files**. The project provides an interactive web interface built with **Streamlit** for easy usage, allowing users to upload files and get instant summaries. The model also supports multiple languages for broader usability.

## Features

- **Text Extraction**:
  - Extract text from **PDF files** using **PyPDF2**.
  - Extract text from **images** using **Tesseract OCR**.
  - Extract text from **audio files** using **SpeechRecognition** and **pydub**.
  
- **Text Summarization**:
  - Summarize the extracted text using the pre-trained **Google T5 model**.
  - Fine-tuned for better summarization results and faster processing.

- **User Interface**:
  - Interactive and easy-to-use web interface built with **Streamlit**.
  - Users can upload files and view the summarized text.

- **Multi-Language Support**:
  - Summarization is available in multiple languages for broader accessibility.

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Optimized the system for fast and efficient text summarization.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/T5-Summarizer.git
cd T5-Summarizer


### 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit application, and you can open the UI in your browser to interact with the summarization model.

## Usage

1. **Upload your file**:
   - Upload a **PDF**, **image**, or **audio file** through the Streamlit interface.
   - The system will extract text from the uploaded file and display it in the input box.

2. **Summarize the text**:
   - Click the **Summarize** button to generate a summary of the extracted text using the **T5 model**.

3. **Multi-language Support**:
   - Select your preferred language from the dropdown menu to generate summaries in different languages.

4. **Results**:
   - The summarized version of the text will be displayed, offering a more concise form of the original content.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary language for the project.
- **Google T5**: For text summarization using the pre-trained T5 model.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web interface.
- **PyPDF2**: For extracting text from PDF files.
- **Tesseract OCR**: For extracting text from images.
- **SpeechRecognition** & **pydub**: For extracting text from audio files.
- **Transformers**: For utilizing Hugging Face's T5 model and tokenization.
